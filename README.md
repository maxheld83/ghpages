This action simply lets you deploy arbitrary folders of static content from your workflow's working directory (`/github/workspace`) to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com).
This works by having your action instance `git push` your chosen asset folder (`BUILD_DIR`) to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository for the `gh-pages` branch to be served.
If you are running this action inside an [organization or user repository](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/) (named `username/username.github.io`) it will deploy to the `master` branch instead.

Remember to add appropriate [filter action](https://github.com/actions/bin/tree/master/filter) as dependencies on this action to avoid deploying from all branches, as well as to avoid "infinite loops" where the deployment itself would trigger another run.

Remember that you may also have to adjust your [repository settings](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/).

Because this action deploys to separate, "deploy-only" branches, you can not use it if you want to deploy from a repo subdirectory such as `docs/`.
In those cases you really don't need a GitHub Action, because you would be committing the build artifacts yourself.
For details see the [GitHub Pages Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/). 

There are already great GitHub actions to use static site generators *and* then deploy to GitHub Pages (for [jekyll](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action), [jekyll](https://github.com/BryanSchuetz/jekyll-deploy-gh-pages), [zola](https://github.com/shalzz/zola-deploy-action) and surely many more to come).
This action isn't that, though I've borrowed much of the git action from these works.

**This action will not build anything, it just deploys.**


## Secrets

Deployment to GitHub pages happens by `git push`ing to the `gh-pages` (or `master`) branch.
To authorise this, the GitHub action needs a secret.
For now, somewhat confusingly, the `GITHUB_TOKEN` [available for every repo](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/storing-secrets/) *does* suffice to push to `gh-pages`, but *does not* suffice to trigger a  page build on GitHub, or even propagate the content to the GitHub content-delivery network.

You therefore **have to [create a custom Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)** much like you'd do for external services (say, Travis). This token must be created with `repo` permissions in order to deploy to Github Pages.
You then have to paste this token into the GitHub UI as a secret under the name `GH_PAT` (repository settings/secrets) and call it in the action as in the below.

I've asked GitHub to streamline this process.
The discussion is documented [here](https://github.com/maxheld83/ghaction-ghpages/issues/1).


## Environment Variables

Just `BUILD_DIR`, the build directory relative to your repository root.
You can also pass `.` if you want to push your repository root.


## Arguments

None.


## Example Usage
